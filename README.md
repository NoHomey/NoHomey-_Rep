# cheating-the-system
============

Repository to store all cheatments made to pass TP (Programming technologies) course in ELSYS (TUES) with grade above the general maximum in the system.

ТП Технологии на програмирането - TP (Programming technologies) course in ***ELSYS (TUES) - Technological shcool "Electronic systems"*** is the course in which I learn most about programming, life, what one really successful person "looks like" and how to become one. We had 3 exams, each beeing 30 minutes long and we were allowed to use all the code we had written in preparation for each exam (yes, we were allowed to cheat if cheating is to use your own built up experience is cheating) with the only purpose to pass each exam with 1 out of [1 or 0].

During mine last two final years in ELSYS (TUES) I have used this repository to store alot more than just an exam preparation code for the Programming technologies course, but as well exam preparation code for other courses.
